To address the compliance issues identified in the audit findings, I will use PowerShell scripts to implement the necessary configurations based on the CIS Benchmark Level 1 for Windows Server 2019. The solution involves creating a set of PowerShell scripts that can be executed on the Windows Server 2019 host (bastion1). These scripts will configure the required security settings outlined in the compliance controls.

Here's an example of how the PowerShell scripts can be structured:

Script 1: Ensure 'Deny access to this computer from the network'
**Purpose:**
This script addresses Compliance Control ID 2.2.21 from the CIS Benchmark Level 1 for Windows Server 2019. It ensures that network access is denied for Guests, the Local account, and members of the Administrators group.

**Execution:**
Run this script on the bastion1 host to enforce the specified network access restrictions.

Script 2: Ensure 'Configure Attack Surface Reduction rules'
**Purpose:**
This script addresses Compliance Control ID 18.9.45.4.1.2 from the CIS Benchmark Level 1 for Windows Server 2019. It configures the Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rule state with the provided GUID.

**Execution:**
Run this script on the bastion1 host to configure ASR rule enforcement mode.
